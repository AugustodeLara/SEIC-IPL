# GREENHOUSE SIMULATION - PIC+ESP32+RASPBERRY+MQTT


The developed system was in order to simulate the basic functioning of a greenhouse. The objective was to link
electronic equipment so that it is possible to control locally and the various
sensors, and in order for them to be correctly attended to, it was necessary to execute a subject at the
throughout the course unit.
For this to be successful, it was necessary to draw up a block diagram where the deliveries as
general functionalities of the system and in order to facilitate the evolution of the project, it was necessary to carry out the
devices such as temperature sensor, brightness, pi Mplab, Pic8F, Raspberry,
Usb-uart, Pickit4, ESP32 and DH11.
